# Chainlink check-in for RediYeti

<img src="rediyeti-rounded-square.svg" alt="Mascot" width="500" height="500"/>

RediYeti from redÂ·dev enables Avalanche validator node operators to guarantee to those who delegate AVAX to their node that they will receive their staking reward no matter what.

This strengthens the Avalanche network by encouraging delegation to more distributed but perhaps less reliable nodes that do not reside on centralized cloud-based virtual servers. With the RediYeti guarantee, now a node with 90% uptime looks just as good to a potential delegator as one with 99.9% uptime.

## Whats done so far:
1. [Design](rediyeti-avax-delegation-guarantor.pdf) (use cases, uml diagrams, etc)
2. Some of the code ([rediyeti-avalanche-oracle](rediyeti-avalanche-adapter))
3. Mascot

## Whats left: 
1. Everything else
